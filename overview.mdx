# OneSwap SDK

OneSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) on Canton Network. The SDK lets you integrate token swaps and liquidity provision into your application with a few lines of TypeScript.

## What you can do

- Swap tokens (CC/Amulet, USDCx) using AMM pricing
- Provide and manage liquidity in pools
- Create custodial wallets for your end users
- Get real-time quotes with slippage protection
- Track swap and LP intent status via events or polling
- View LP positions, earnings, APR/APY

## How it works

OneSwap uses an **intent-based** execution model:

1. Your app creates a swap or LP intent via the SDK.
2. The intent returns a `depositAddress` where tokens should be sent.
3. OneSwap detects the deposit on-chain and executes automatically.
4. Your app polls or listens for completion.

## Core model

- Formula: `x * y = k` (constant product)
- Fee: 0.3% per swap (80% to LPs, 20% to platform)
- Intents expire 30 minutes after creation

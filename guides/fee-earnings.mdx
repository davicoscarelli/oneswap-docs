title: Fee Earnings
description: Track and collect your share of swap fees through the SDK.
---

OneSwap shares a portion of platform swap fees with SDK developers. Once your account is enabled for fee sharing, fees accumulate automatically on every swap made through your API keys.

## How It Works

1. A user executes a swap through your integration
2. The platform collects its standard swap fee
3. Your configured share of that fee is credited to your developer account
4. When accumulated fees reach the collection threshold, they are transferred to your fee wallet

## Check Your Earnings

```typescript
const earnings = await client.fees.getEarnings()

console.log(earnings.feeSharePct)   // e.g. 0.25 (25%)
console.log(earnings.feeWallet)     // your fee wallet address
console.log(earnings.accumulated)   // { CC: "0.054321", USDCx: "12.50" }
console.log(earnings.totalCollected) // { CC: "1.234567" }
```

## View Fee Event History

Each swap that generates a developer fee creates a fee event:

```typescript
const history = await client.fees.getEarningsHistory({
  page: 1,
  limit: 20,
  token: 'CC', // optional filter
})

for (const event of history.events) {
  console.log(`${event.tokenName}: ${event.developerFee} from ${event.inputAmount} input`)
}
```

## View Collection History

When fees are collected (transferred to your wallet), a collection record is created:

```typescript
const collections = await client.fees.getCollections({ page: 1, limit: 20 })

for (const col of collections.collections) {
  console.log(`${col.amount} ${col.tokenName} collected at ${col.collectedAt}`)
}
```

## Collection Thresholds

Fees are collected when the accumulated amount reaches the threshold for that token:

| Token | Threshold |
|---|---|
| CC (Amulet) | 5 |
| USDCx | 50 |
| Other tokens | 25 |

## Developer Portal

You can also view your earnings in the [developer portal](/developer/earnings) under the **Earnings** tab. The portal shows:

- Your fee share percentage
- Fee wallet address
- Accumulated and collected amounts by token
- Recent fee events
- Full collection history

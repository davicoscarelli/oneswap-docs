# Fee Sharing & Earning

Every swap on OneSwap generates a **2% fee**. That fee is split between liquidity providers, the platform, and — for SDK-powered swaps — the developer who built the integration.

## Fee Structure

### Total Swap Fee — 2%

Every token swap charges a **2% fee** on the input amount. Here's how it's distributed:

| Recipient | Share | Percentage |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Liquidity Providers** | 80% of fee | **1.6%** |
| **Platform** | 20% of fee | **0.4%** |

### SDK Developer Fee Split

When a swap is executed through the **OneSwap SDK** (by a third-party app), the platform's 0.4% share is split equally with the developer:

| Recipient | Share | Percentage |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Liquidity Providers** | 80% of fee | **1.6%** |
| **Platform** | 10% of fee | **0.2%** |
| **SDK Developer** | 10% of fee | **0.2%** |

This means developers earn revenue simply by integrating OneSwap into their apps.

### Fee Flow — Direct Swap (oneswap.xyz)

```
User swaps 1,000 CC
  ├── Traffic fee → Canton Network (variable, small)
  ├── 16 CC (1.6%) → Liquidity Providers
  ├── 4 CC (0.4%) → OneSwap Platform
  └── Remainder → Swap calculation → Output tokens to user
```

### Fee Flow — SDK Swap (third-party app)

```
User swaps 1,000 CC
  ├── Traffic fee → Canton Network (variable, small)
  ├── 16 CC (1.6%) → Liquidity Providers
  ├── 2 CC (0.2%) → OneSwap Platform
  ├── 2 CC (0.2%) → SDK Developer
  └── Remainder → Swap calculation → Output tokens to user
```

### Traffic Fee — Variable

The Canton Network charges a small traffic fee per transaction. This is separate from the swap fee and goes to the network. The exact amount varies by transaction size and is shown in the swap quote.

## How LPs Earn

When you provide liquidity, you earn **1.6% of every swap** proportional to your share of the pool.

### The Math

```
Your earnings per swap = LP fee (1.6%) × Swap amount × (Your LP tokens / Total LP tokens)
```

**Example:**

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Your LP tokens | 100 |
| Total LP tokens in pool | 10,000 |
| Your pool share | 1% |
| Swap volume today | 500,000 CC |
| LP fees generated | 8,000 CC (1.6%) |
| **Your earnings today** | **80 CC** |

### How Fees Accumulate

Fees don't appear as a separate balance. Instead, they increase the value of your LP tokens:

1. A user swaps 1,000 CC for USDCx
2. 16 CC (1.6%) is added to the pool reserves
3. Your LP tokens now represent a slightly larger share of reserves
4. When you withdraw, you receive more tokens than you deposited

This means your earnings are **automatic and continuous** — no claiming or harvesting required.

## Understanding APR

The **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** shown on each pool is calculated from recent trading activity:

```
APR = (LP fees earned over 7 days / Total pool value) × (365 / 7) × 100
```

| APR | What It Means |
|-----|---------------|
| 0% | No swaps in the past 7 days |
| 5% | Moderate activity — steady returns |
| 20%+ | High volume — strong earning opportunity |

<Warning>
APR is based on historical data and is not guaranteed. Future returns depend on trading volume and can vary significantly.
</Warning>

## Earning Example — Full Walkthrough

Let's say you provide liquidity to the CC/USDCx pool:

**Day 0: You Deposit**
- You add **1,000 CC** and **1,600 USDCx** to the pool
- Total pool: 100,000 CC + 160,000 USDCx
- Your share: **1%**

**Over 30 Days: Trading Happens**
- 2,000,000 CC in total swap volume passes through the pool
- LP fees generated: 32,000 CC worth of value (1.6%)
- Your 1% share: **~320 CC worth of fees earned**

**Day 30: You Withdraw**
- You redeem your LP tokens
- You receive your original deposit plus accrued fees
- Your profit: fee earnings proportional to your 1% share

## For SDK Developers

If you integrate OneSwap into your application using the SDK, you automatically earn **0.2% of every swap** made through your integration.

### How It Works

1. Sign up for an SDK API key
2. Integrate swap functionality into your app
3. Every swap your users make generates 0.2% revenue for you

### Revenue Example

| Monthly Swap Volume | Your Revenue (0.2%) |
|---|---|
| 100,000 CC | 200 CC |
| 1,000,000 CC | 2,000 CC |
| 10,000,000 CC | 20,000 CC |

No upfront cost. No minimum volume. You earn from the first swap.

## Maximizing Returns

### For Liquidity Providers

- **Choose high-volume pools** — More swaps = more fees. Check 24-hour volume and APR.
- **Provide more liquidity** — Your earnings scale linearly with your pool share.
- **Stay in the pool longer** — Fees accumulate continuously.
- **Monitor impermanent loss** — If the price ratio changes dramatically, fee earnings may not fully offset the loss.

### For SDK Developers

- **Drive swap volume** — The more users swap through your app, the more you earn.
- **Integrate multiple pools** — Give users more options to increase total volume.
- **Build great UX** — A smooth swap experience drives repeat usage.

## Fee Summary

| Fee | Rate | Recipient | Source |
|-----|------|-----------|--------|
| LP Fee | 1.6% | Liquidity Providers | All swaps |
| Platform Fee | 0.4% | OneSwap | Direct swaps |
| Platform Fee (SDK) | 0.2% | OneSwap | SDK swaps |
| Developer Fee | 0.2% | SDK Developer | SDK swaps |
| Traffic Fee | Variable | Canton Network | All swaps |

## Featured App Rewards

OneSwap participates in the Canton Network's **Featured App Rewards** program. This generates additional CC rewards from the network based on swap activity:

- Each swap creates an **activity marker** on the Canton Network
- The network distributes CC rewards to featured apps based on activity
- These rewards supplement the platform's sustainability

<Info>
Featured App Rewards are a platform-level benefit and don't directly affect individual LP earnings. The 1.6% LP fee remains the primary earning mechanism for liquidity providers.

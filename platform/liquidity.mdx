# How Liquidity Provision Works

Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit token pairs into pools and earn a share of every swap fee. Your liquidity makes swaps possible — and you get paid for it.

## The LP Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Pool">
    Choose which token pair you want to provide liquidity for (e.g., CC/USDCx). You can see current reserves, fee earnings, and APR for each pool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Deposit Amounts">
    Specify how much of the first token you want to deposit. The required amount of the second token is calculated automatically based on the current pool ratio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an LP Intent">
    Confirm your deposit. You receive a deposit address where both tokens need to be sent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Both Tokens">
    Transfer both token amounts to the deposit address. You have **30 minutes** to complete both deposits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive LP Tokens">
    Once both deposits are detected, OneSwap mints LP tokens proportional to your share of the pool and sends them to the first wallet that deposited.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How LP Tokens Work

LP tokens represent your ownership share of a liquidity pool.

- **Proportional** — If you deposit 1% of the pool's total value, you receive 1% of the LP tokens
- **Appreciating** — As swap fees accumulate, each LP token is backed by more underlying reserves
- **Transferable** — LP tokens are standard Canton tokens
- **Redeemable** — Withdraw your LP tokens anytime to receive your share of both underlying tokens plus accrued fees

### Example

| | Your Deposit | Pool Total | Your Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| CC | 100 | 10,000 | 1% |
| USDCx | 50 | 5,000 | 1% |
| LP Tokens | 100 | 10,000 | 1% |

After 1,000 swaps generating fees, your 1% share now represents more CC and USDCx than you originally deposited.

## Deposit Requirements

- **Both tokens required** — You must deposit both tokens in the pair
- **Ratio must match** — Deposits must match the current pool ratio (the app calculates this for you)
- **30-minute window** — Both deposits must arrive within 30 minutes
- **Incomplete deposits are refunded** — If only one token arrives before timeout, it's returned to you

## LP Intent Lifecycle

```
pending → partial (one token received) → completed (both received, LP minted)
                                        → expired (second token didn't arrive in time)
        → expired (no deposits in 30 min)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Waiting for both token deposits |
| `partial` | One token received, waiting for the second |
| `completed` | Both tokens received, LP tokens minted |
| `expired` | Timeout reached — any deposited tokens are refunded |

## Withdrawing Liquidity

You can withdraw your liquidity at any time:

1. Go to **View Positions** to see your LP holdings
2. Choose how many LP tokens to withdraw (partial or full)
3. Receive your proportional share of both underlying tokens

Your withdrawal includes all accumulated swap fees — there's no separate "claim" step. When you withdraw, you get your original deposit plus any fees earned.

<Info>
You can withdraw partially. If you hold 100 LP tokens, you can withdraw 50 and keep earning with the remaining 50.
</Info>

## Risks

- **Impermanent loss** — If the price ratio between the two tokens changes significantly from when you deposited, you may receive less value than if you had simply held the tokens. Fee earnings can offset this.
- **Pool utilization** — Earnings depend on swap volume. Low-volume pools generate fewer fees.

## Tips

- **Check APR** before depositing — it shows the annualized return based on recent 7-day trading volume
- **Monitor your positions** — Use the View Positions tab to track your earnings in real time
- **Start small** — Test with a small deposit to understand the flow before committing larger amounts

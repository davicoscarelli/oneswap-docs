# What is OneSwap?

OneSwap is a decentralized token swap and liquidity protocol built on the **Canton Network**. It lets you exchange tokens, provide liquidity to earn trading fees, and manage your assets — all without manual transaction signing.

## How It Works

OneSwap uses an **intent-based architecture**. Instead of signing complex blockchain transactions, you simply:

1. Tell OneSwap what you want to do (swap, add liquidity, etc.)
2. Send your tokens to a deposit address
3. OneSwap handles the rest automatically

No account creation. No approval transactions. No gas fees to manage. Just send and receive.

## Core Features

### Token Swaps

Exchange tokens instantly using our automated market maker (AMM). OneSwap uses the **constant product formula** (x · y = k) to calculate fair exchange rates based on pool reserves.

- Swap between CC (Amulet), USDCx, and other supported tokens
- Get a price quote before you commit
- Set slippage tolerance to protect against price movement
- Receive output tokens to the same wallet you sent from

### Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are the engine behind OneSwap. Each pool holds reserves of two tokens and enables swaps between them.

- Pools are created with a pair of tokens (e.g., CC/USDCx)
- The exchange rate is determined by the ratio of reserves
- Every swap adjusts the reserves, keeping the product constant

### Earning Through Fees

When you provide liquidity to a pool, you earn a share of every swap fee generated by that pool. The more liquidity you provide relative to the pool, the more you earn.
